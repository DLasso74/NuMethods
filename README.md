# NuMethods Proyect Repository
by Melissa Alejandra Acosta, Maria Alejandra Garzón and Darío Esteban Lasso.

This is a repository for the undergrad course "Numerical Methods for Engineers", it consists of creating a program of finite elements using Python that solves the Wave equation in two dimensions; along with a pre-made problem that will be solved using the equation and the option to solve any problem with parameters that the user can change. 

The problem to be solved consists of the propagation of waves on a surface, caused by the presence of one or more sources.
